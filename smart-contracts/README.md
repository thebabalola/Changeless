- **‚ö° Fast Transactions:** Leverages Ethereum's fast block times
- **‚è∞ Timeout Protection:** Anti-griefing mechanism with forfeit system
- **üèÜ Social Competition:** Winner celebration and challenge sharing system

Create/join/play flows for PvP Tic Tac Toe:
- Bets escrowed in contract; winner takes all
- Turn enforcement and move validation
- Automatic winner detection (3-in-a-row)
- Timeout/forfeit mechanism (anti-griefing)
- Read-only getters for UI rendering
- Events for off-chain indexing and realtime UI

## üß∞ Tech & Tooling

- **Language:** Solidity ^0.8.x
- **Framework:** Hardhat
- **Network:** Base Sepolia Testnet
- **Dependencies:** OpenZeppelin (ReentrancyGuard, helpers)

**Key Features:**

- Winner celebration and social sharing

## üéØ Game Rules

1. **Board:** 3x3 grid with positions 0-8
2. **Moves:** Player 1 uses X (value 1), Player 2 uses O (value 2)
3. **Winning:** Three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
4. **Betting:** Both players must bet equal amounts
5. **Reward:** Winner receives both players' ETH
6. **Timeout:** 24-hour timeout per move, forfeit available after timeout

## üîß Smart Contract Functions

### Public Functions

- `createGame(uint256 betAmount, uint8 moveIndex)` - Create new game with first move
- `joinGame(uint256 gameId, uint8 moveIndex)` - Join existing game
- `play(uint256 gameId, uint8 moveIndex)` - Make a move in ongoing game
- `forfeitGame(uint256 gameId)` - Forfeit game due to timeout

### Read-Only Functions

- `getGame(uint256 gameId)` - Get game details
- `getLatestGameId()` - Get total number of games created
- `getTimeRemaining(uint256 gameId)` - Get time remaining for current move

### Suggested Game Struct

```solidity
struct Game {
    address playerOne;
    address playerTwo;      // address(0) until joined
    uint256 betAmount;      // in wei
    uint8[9] board;         // 0=empty, 1=X, 2=O
    bool isPlayerOneTurn;   // true=>X turn
    address winner;         // address(0) until decided
    uint256 lastMoveTs;     // unix timestamp of last move
    // optional: status enum (Active, Ended, Forfeited)
}
```

## ‚è∞ Timeout / Forfeit Mechanism

- `lastMoveTs` updated on each valid move
- Constant threshold (e.g., 24h) enforced
- If opponent exceeds threshold, current player can call `forfeitGame` to end and withdraw
- Emits `GameForfeited(gameId, winner)` event

## üîí Security Features

- **Input Validation:** All moves validated for bounds and availability
- **Turn Enforcement:** Players can only move on their turn
- **Fund Security:** ETH locked in contract until game completion
- **Winner Verification:** Automatic winner detection prevents disputes
- **Timeout Protection:** Anti-griefing with forfeit mechanism
- **Reentrancy Protection:** Secure against reentrancy attacks

**Security Considerations:**
- Reentrancy protection on state-changing functions that transfer ETH
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Input validation (bounds, empty cell, correct turn/move)
- Use of custom errors for gas-efficient revert reasons
- Pull over push for payouts (if adopting claim pattern)

## üì° Events (for Indexers/UI)

- `GameCreated(gameId, playerOne, betAmount, moveIndex)`
- `GameJoined(gameId, playerTwo, moveIndex)`
- `MovePlayed(gameId, by, moveIndex)`
- `GameWon(gameId, winner, payout)`
- `GameForfeited(gameId, winner)`

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Hardhat
- Ethereum wallet for testing

### Smart Contract Development

```bash
# Navigate to contract directory
cd smart-contracts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy to testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia

## üß™ Testing

The smart contract includes comprehensive tests covering:
- ‚úÖ Game creation and joining
- ‚úÖ Turn-based gameplay
- ‚úÖ Move validation (bounds, occupied spots)
- ‚úÖ Winner detection for both players
- ‚úÖ Error handling for invalid operations
- ‚úÖ Timeout and forfeit mechanisms

**Testing Details:**
- Core flow: create ‚Üí join ‚Üí play ‚Üí win (X and O)
- Validation failures: out-of-bounds, occupied, wrong turn/move
- Timeout scenarios and forfeit edge cases
- Security tests: reentrancy, bad inputs, invariant checks

**Run tests:**
```bash
cd smart-contracts
npm test
```
